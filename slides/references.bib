  Abstract                 = {This document describes a method to use fixed size, flat byte strings to forward CCNx packets with Hierarchically Structured Variable Length Identifiers (HSVLIs), thus simplifying the work done at a packet Forwarder. A first byte string, called the Interest Label (IL), represents the query in an Interest. The Interest Label remains invariant as a packet moves through the network. A second byte string, called the Forwarding Label (FL), represents the longest matching prefix in the routing tables that matches the Interest name. The Forwarding Label may change hop-by-hop if the underlying routing tables change, such that it always represents the best match at the previous hop. A Content Object, sent in response to an IL/FL Interest, carries the IL/FL header along the return path so the Content Object may be forwarded along the proper path.},
